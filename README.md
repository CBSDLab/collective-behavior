# Granovetter's threshold model of collective behavior

Granovetter's (1978) threshold theory of collective behavior addresses a limitation of most models of diffusion and implementation by recognizing that people have different thresholds for joining (or leaving) a collective behavior. This is highlighted in [Malcom Gladwell's podcast](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/137b80e5-e328-42ac-82cc-efb3a47d3adc)
