# Granovetter's threshold model of collective behavior

Granovetter's (1978) threshold theory of collective behavior addresses a limitation of most models of diffusion and implementation by recognizing that people have different thresholds for joining (or leaving) a collective behavior. This is highlighted in [Malcom Gladwell's podcast episode "The Big Man Can't Shoot"](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/revisionist-history/the-big-man-cant-shoot).
