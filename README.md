# Granovetter's threshold model of collective behavior

Granovetter's (1978) threshold theory of collective behavior addresses a limitation of most models of diffusion and implementation by recognizing that people have different thresholds for joining (or leaving) a collective behavior. This is highlighted in [Malcom Gladwell's podcast episode "The Big Man Can't Shoot"](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/revisionist-history/the-big-man-cant-shoot), where he builds out the idea with an interview with the basketball player Rick Berry. 

The basic idea is that the cumulative distribution of adopting (or de-adopting) an innovation is a function of the proportion of people who have already adopted.

Grannovetter's threshold theory is one of the most widely cited papers in the social sciences and can be incorported into a system dynamics model to reflect the heterogeneity of individual threshold effects.
